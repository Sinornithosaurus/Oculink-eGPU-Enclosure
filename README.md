# Oculink eGPU Enclosure

An enclosure made from a bunch of Makerbeam parts, a Cooler Master vertical GPU holder, and 2 aluminium brackets (either laser-cut or hand cut).

The cooler master bracket was probably not necessary. However, I want this thing to be durable and transportable, and I found that it's providing great rigidity for what I need.

As of now I haven't screwed down a power supply, but It all fits together well. It should work well, I've got some feet coming in so I'll test those too. After I confirm it all works, I'll look into a proper cover, probably made out of wood :)
