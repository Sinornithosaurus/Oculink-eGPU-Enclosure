# Oculink eGPU Enclosure

An enclosure made from a bunch of Makerbeam parts, a Cooler Master vertical GPU holder, and 2 laser cut aluminium brackets.

The cooler master bracket was probably not necessary. However, I want this thing to be durable and transportable, and I found that it's providing great rigidity for what I need.

WARNING! I have yet to make this. I've got most of the parts coming, but I'm kinda waiting on my GPD Win Mini to put it all together. I will update this page once I confirm it all works!
